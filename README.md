# Reinforcement Learning
Application of three Q-Learning (Reinforcement Learninng) algorithms to two Multi Agents Systems: 
1. Ball Balancing 
2. Two Link Rigid Manipulator

The implmentation shows one centralized and two decentralized strategies. In particular one of the two decentralized approaches 
is called **Hysteretic** and implements *the optimistic agent* idea.\
Even a comparision between the three methods have been discussed.

See the [paper](https://github.com/ettorecelozzi/HystereticQ-Learning/blob/master/Paper_MAS.pdf) for further details.

In the QTables folders are stored the Q-Tables (both csv and pkl) obtained from the training phase. These can be easily used in the test phase.
